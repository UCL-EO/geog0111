    "Learning is mostly blocked into two-week chunks, with a test you need to submit at the end of the block. You will receive feedback from your test submission to help you learn from what you have done well and not so well. It is important that you submit materials for these tests. It is not about 'getting the right answer', but giving us the opportunity to regularly see your progress.\n",

We have seen that if we try to access a variable before we have declared it, it will throw a `NameError`, telling us this. Having seen this type of error once, and understanding why it occurred should prepare us for the next time we see one similar.\n",

    "We have seen one of the *dangers* of a notebook: it allows you to go back and forth running cells. This can lead to confusion, as the next time you run the same notebook in cell order, you may not get the same result! It is one of the most common mistakes for a beginner to make, so be aware of this, and try to always run the cells in the same order. **You can test for this type of error by restarting the kernel, clearing the output, and running all cells.**\n",
