    "In this session, we will learn how to read files and similar resources. We will mainly use [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) and the local package [gurlpath](geog0111/gurlpath) derived from [`urlpath`](https://github.com/chrono-meter/urlpath). We will also cover opening and closing files, and some simple read- and write-operations.\n",

    "Sometimes, we pass a filename or URL to some reading routine. But other times, we need to pass a stream. A [stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams) is a channel through which we may send and/or receive information. This is different to a file, which is where information may reside, but we may for instance open a stream to write to a file. In Python, we call the object that we get when opening a stream a *file object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A example of when we would use a stream is for instance when we want to take some information from a URL and pass it directly on to some Python function. A more long-winded way of doing that would be to save the information from the URL into a file on the local file system, then to read from that file into the function. Using a stream, we avoid the need to save a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course sometimes, it may be convenient to store a temporary file for such a process, especially if we might want to re-use the file information. This is called building a **cache**. Each time we try to pull data from the original stream then, we would instead read from the local cache. You will notice that web browsers make extensive use of such ideas in trying to speed up the display of web pages: they try only to pull a new version of some data if it has changed.\n",

    "       pass\n",

    "Not all data files we find on the web may be so straightforward to read though. In [020_Python_files](020_Python_files.ipynb) we saw data of Monthly Southeast England precipitation (mm) in a tabular form on the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadukp/data/monthly/HadSEEP_monthly_qc.txt). We would commonly use the Python package [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to read and analyses such data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more general and reliable method with `pandas` then is to provide a stream to read from. We demonstrate that here with the Met Office data of . [By inspection](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadukp/data/monthly/HadSEEP_monthly_qc.txt), the dataset is seen to have a variable number of spaces between the data columns. This is known as 'whitespace' (i.e. ` ` or `\\t` characters). This makes it more complex to read into `pandas` than a CSV format, and we need to specify a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) meaning 'one or more space'. This is `r\"[ ]{1,}\"` and we give the keyword `sep` for `pandas` as `sep=r\"[ ]{1,}\"`. Further for `pandas` in this case we must specify that we should use the Python engine to interpret `engine='python'`. Other features of the dataset are that the first 3 rows of data are metadata and should be skipped in reading the dataset: `skiprows=3`, with the 4th line the data column headers. Finally, we see that 'no data' values are given here as the value `-99.9`: `na_values=[-99.9]`. \n",
