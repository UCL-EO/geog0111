    "\n",
    "In this session, we will learn about files and similar resources. We will introduce the standard Python library [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) which is how we deal with file paths, as well as the local package [gurlpath](geog0111/gurlpath) derived from [`urlpath`](https://github.com/chrono-meter/urlpath) that allows a similar object-oriented approach with files and other objects on the web. We will also cover opening and closing files, and some simple read- and write-operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Resource location\n",
    "\n",
    "We store information on a computer in files, or file-like resources. We will use the term 'file' below to mean either of these concepts, other than specific issues relating to particular types of file/resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get information from files, we need to be able to specify some **address** for the file/resource location, along with some way of interacting with the file. These concepts are captured in the idea of a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) (Uniform Resource Indicator). You will most likely have come across the related idea of a [Uniform Resource Locator (URL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL), which is a URL such as [https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/philip-lewis](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/people/academic-staff/philip-lewis)\n",
    "that gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the location of the resource: `people/academic-staff/philip-lewis`\n",
    "* the access and interpretation protocol: [`https`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) (secure [`http`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol))\n",
    "* the network domain name: [`www.geog.ucl.ac.uk`](https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we visit this URL using an appropriate tool such as a browser, the tool can access and interpret the information in the resource: in this case, interpret the [html code](https://www.w3schools.com/html) in the file pointed to by the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we will be used to the idea of accessing `files` on the computer. These may be in the local file system, or on some network or cloud storage that might be accessible from the local file system. An example of such a file would be some Python code file such as \n",
    "[`geog0111/helloWorld.py`](http://localhost:8888/edit/notebooks/geog0111/helloWorld.py).\n"

    "### binary and text data\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful at this point to distinguish text (ASCII) and binary resources. Text resources are in a human-readable format, so you can just directly 'look at' the file contents to see what is there. Examples of this are [csv-format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files, [html pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [yaml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or [json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) configuration files, and even these [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Information in text files is, as noted, easily readable: you can open the file in any text editor to see the contents. However, for large datasets, and datasets with particular structures (e.g. on grids), it is very inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical **binary** files include (most) image data and compressed data (e.g. [zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format)) files), where size is more important, as well as encrypted data, where human-readability might not be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text files designed for different purposes will mostly have some format definition or conventions. This means that although we can easily scan e.g. a [json file](https://json.org/example.html`), there is a set way of laying such files out, so we can interpret them by eye or in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files will also have some defined format, but in this case, the user is generally forced to use some software reader to interpret the data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you wish to access some file or dataset, you will generally know which format the file will be in, so can target an appropriate reader. Quite often though, we have to we might need to examine a dataset before deciding on some parameters for an interpreter, particularly with text datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these notes, we will learn how to access and use binary and text datasets in Python, but from the local file system, and online from URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to learn some core tools for file and URL access. We will be using the object-oriented [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) package for local files, and a local variant of [`urlpath`](https://github.com/chrono-meter/urlpath) called [`gurlpath`](geog0111/gurlpath.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be also using `yaml`, `json` and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) packages for reading particular text file types, and introducing [`gdal`](https://gdal.org/python/) for binary image files."

    "In this section, we have extended the types of data we might come across to include groups . We dealt with ordered groups of various types (`tuple`, `list`), and introduced the numpy package for numpy arrays (`np.array`). We saw dictionaries as collections with which we refer to individual items with a key.\n",

    "We learned in the previous section how to pull apart a dataset presented as a string using loops and various using methods and to construct a useful dataset 'by hand' in a list or similar structure. It is useful, when learning to program, to know how to do this.\n",

    "Here, we saw that packages such as numpy provide higher level routines that make reading data easier, and we would generally use these in practice. We saw how we can use `zip()` to help load a dataset from arrays into a dictionary, and also the value of using a dictionary representation when saving numpy files."
