    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we used [`pathlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) and the local package [gurlpath](geog0111/gurlpath) derived from [`urlpath`](https://github.com/chrono-meter/urlpath) to open object streams from URLs and files. \n",

    "In this session, we will extend this to deal with reading and writing to text and binary files and URLs.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need some understanding of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [001 Using Notebooks](001_Notebook_use.ipynb)\n",
    "* [002 Unix](002_Unix.ipynb) with a good familiarity with the UNIX commands we have been through.\n",

    "* [020_Python_files](020_Python_files.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to recall details from [020_Python_files](020_Python_files.ipynb) on using the two packages.\n",
