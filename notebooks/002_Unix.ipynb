    "#### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this course is about coding in Python, it can be of great value to you to learn at least some basic concepts and commands of the operating system. To that end, in this session we will learn some basic `unix` commands. You will be able to use these in almost any modern computing operating system may use: the `unix` shell is a core part of [`linux`](https://www.linux.org/) and [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) and is directly available to you even in [Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). If you use these notes through the [`JupyterLab`](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) interface, even from a mobile device, you will have access to a [`unix` shell](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/terminal.html?highlight=bash) to run commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many online tutorials on unix. A good place to start backup material and some more features for the material we will cover today is [software-carpentry.org](https://v4.software-carpentry.org/shell/index.html).\n",
