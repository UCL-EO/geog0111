# Installation of these notes on UCL JupyterHub

We expect you to run these notes and do this course using Jupyter notebooks, on the [UCL JupyterHub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/).

If you know what you are doing, and have accessed the notes in this way before, then you can go straight to the [UCL JupyterHub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/).

1. If you are not logged on inside the UCL domain, then you will need to make sure you have the [UCL VPN](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/get-connected/ucl-virtual-private-network-vpn) installed and running
2. Log on the the [UCL JupyterHub](https://jupyter.data-science.rc.ucl.ac.uk/).
3. In a shell, type:

    /shared/groups/jrole001/geog0111/init/init0111.sh > init0111.log

   This will clone this repository and set up all files and links you need.
