    "We have achieved something today, in creating a Python code in a file, making it executable, and running it. However, it is a little limited in scope: it just prints out the message the we **hard wired** into it.\n",
    "\n",

    "In this session, we have learned the usual form of a Python script, including the `#! /usr/bin/env python`  on the first line of the file to call the Python interpreter. We have seen how to include document strings telling any user how to use the codes we develop, and well as providing lots of comments with `#` lines to describe what we are doing in the code, and why. We have seen that a Python script will typically finish with something along the lines of:\n",

    "the `main()` function serving to provide a call to the codes we have developed, as well as any interface to the command line. We have seen that `sys.argv` contains command line parameters (and the program name) which we can use to modify the behaviour of the script. \n",

    "We have seen how to run a Python script from a notebook, using `%run` or via a bash shell with `%%bash`. We have seen that to 'run' a Python script, we need to change the file permissions iusing `chmod`, either in `bash` or using `Path().chmod()`. We have used the octal code `755` to change the file permissions for execution."
