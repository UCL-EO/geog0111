    "You will obviously need to submit computer codes as part of this assessment. Some flexibility in the style of these codes is to be expected. For example, when asked to write a function, so students might choose to modularise and test the problem further and have multiple sub-functions that are finally called from the required function. This is fine to do, and can often be a good idea if the problem is complex or there are re-usable modular parts of code you might want to use (e.g. for printing). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to achieve distinction-level marks, then, on top of the main requirements we lay out here, we would be looking for features such as: maturity and detail in testing your codes; excellent code style; excellent presentation; and flexibility in the code (e.g. don't fix variable you can make variables or keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "All codes needed to demonstrate that you have performed the core tasks are required to be included in the submission. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you use a piece of code verbatim that you have taken from the course pages or any other source, **you must acknowledge this** in comments in your text. **Not to do so is plagiarism**. Where you have taken some part (e.g. a few lines) of someone else's code, **you should also indicate this**.

    "This example makes it clear that significant modifications have been made to the code structure (and probably to its efficiency) although the basic model and looping comes from an existing piece of code.

Note also that this is a poor example of a function, as there is no real document string and little comment on the code operation.\n",

We do not want you to get anyone else to significantly helped you to develop the code (e.g. written the main part of it for you & you've just copied that with some minor modifications).

    "Plagiarism in coding is a tricky issue. One reason for that is that often the best way to learn something like this is to find an example that someone else has written and adapt that to your purposes. Equally, if someone has written some tool/library to do what you want to do, it would generally not be worthwhile for you to write your own but to concentrate on using that to achieve something new. Even in general code writing (i.e. when not submitting it as part of your assessment) you and anyone else who ever has to read your code would find it of value to make reference to where you found the material to base what you did on. The key issue to bear in mind in this work, as it is submitted ‘as your own work’ is that, to avoid being accused of plagiarism and to allow a fair assessment of what you have done, you must clearly acknowledge which parts of it are your own, and the degree to which you could claim them to be your own.\n",

    "For example, based on ... is absolutely fine, and you would certainly be given credit for what you have done. In many circumstances 'taken verbatim from ...' would also be fine (provided it is acknowledged) but then you would be given credit for what you had done with the code that you had taken from elsewhere (e.g. you find some elegant way of doing the graphs that someone has written and you make use of it for presenting your results).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between what you submit here and the code you might write if this were not a piece submitted for assessment is that you the vast majority of the credit you will gain for the code will be based on the degree to which you demonstrate that you can write code to achieve the required tasks. There would obviously be some credit for taking codes from the coursenotes and bolting them together into something that achieves the overall aim: provided that worked, and you had commented it adequately and acknowledge what the extent of your efforts had been, you should be able to achieve a pass in that component of the work. If there was no original input other than vbolting pieces of existing code together though, you be unlikely to achieve more than a pass. If you get less than a pass in another component of the coursework, that then puts you in danger of an overall fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provided you achieve the core tasks, the more original work that you do/show (that is of good quality), the higher the mark you will get. Once you have achieved the core tasks, even if you try something and don’t quite achieve it, is is probably worth including, as you may get marks for what you have done (or that fact that it was a good or interesting thing to try to do)."
