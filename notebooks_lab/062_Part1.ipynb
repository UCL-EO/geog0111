    "In this task, you will be writing codes that download and interpret (convert units) for two datasets of the Del Norte catchment in Colorado, USA for the years 2015-2019 inclusive. The main coding exercise is a Python script that when you run it, downloads the data and stores them in CSV format files. In a notebook, you run the script and show the results. In a second notebook, you produce plots of the datasets. You save the code and two notebooks to PDF files, and submit the work."

    "##  Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrology of the Rio Grande Headwaters in Colorado, USA is snowmelt dominated. It varies considerably from year to year and may very further under a changing climate. One of the tools we use to understand monitor processes in such an area is a mathemetical ('environmental') model describing the main physical processes affecting hydrology in the catchment. Such a model could help understand current behaviour and allow some prediction about possible future scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2 of your assessment you will be using, calibrating and validating such a model that relates temperature and snow cover in the catchment to river flow. \n",
    "![](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/hero_backgrounds/NM_Rio_Grande_del_Norte_Sign_640.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the model to describe the streamflow at the Del Norte measurement station, just on the edge of the catchment. You will use environmental (temperature) data and snow cover observations to drive the model. You will perform calibration and testing by comparing model output with observed streamflow data.\n",

The problem with the Colorado State [Climate data site](http://climate.colostate.edu/data_access.html) is that you cannot directly query or download the data. Instead you will need to manually save the data, most easily by copying and pasting the data columns into a file. The final option is a copy of the data from the Colorado State [Climate data site](http://climate.colostate.edu/data_access.html). We try to keep this up to date on an annual basis, but cannot guarantee that.

You may need to try out several options in reading the data into `pandas` if it does not automatically load correctly.
