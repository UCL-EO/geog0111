    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python has a rich set of modules and data types by default, for numerical computing you'll be using two main libraries that conform the backbone of the [Python scientific stack](https://scipy.org/about.html). These libraries implement a great deal of functionality related to mathematical operations and efficient computations on large data volumes. These libraries are [`numpy`](http://numpy.org) and [`scipy`](http://scipy.org). `numpy`, which we will concentrate on in this section, deals with efficient arrays, similar to lists, that simplify many common processing operations. Of course, just doing calculations isn't much fun if you can't plot some results. To do this, we use the [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org) library that we have seen in previous sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it interesting to read the recent [numpy paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) in Nature for some background and detail on `numpy`.\n",

    "In this section, you have been introduced to the `numpy` package and some detail on arrays. The big advantages of `numpy` are that you can easily perform array operators (such as adding two arrays together), and that `numpy` has a large number of useful functions for manipulating N-dimensional data in array form. This makes it particularly appropriate for raster geospatial data processing.\n",
