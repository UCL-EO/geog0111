    "\n",
    "You can find much information on using notebooks on the [web](https://jupyter.org/), so you might start by exploring some of that.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your first Jupyter notebook of the class. Jupyter notebooks will form the primary teaching and learning tool in this course. The format of the notebooks will be similar for all sessions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Course material\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find full, up to date information on this course GEOG0111 on the [UCL course moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=21495). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Course load\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended to be 25 % of your course load for the term. You will find fuller information on the [GEOG0111 course moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=21495), but that percentage should give you some idea of the amount of effort we are expecting you to put in (on average) per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be expected to learn from what we present in these notebooks and by following up material referenced and wider resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning is mostly blocked into two-week chunks, with a test you need to submit at the end of the block. You will receive feedback from your test submission to help you learn from what you have done well and not so well. It is important that you submit materials for these tests. It is not about 'getting the right answer', but giving us the opportunity to regularly gauge your progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be two pieces of work that you submit for formal assessment on the course: one half way through, and one at the end. Again, we will provide you with feedback on these.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be covering a number of notebooks per week in a learning chunk, and you will need to keep up. If you find you are having problems, or there are reasons you cannot work, you must let us know so we can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide more information on learning in this course and the resources you have access to on the course moodle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no prerequisites for this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can 'run' the code in a code block using the 'run' widget (above) or hitting the keys ('typing') <shift> and <return> at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "The session should take around 20 minutes though you will spend longer on follow-up material and exercises. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Some resources\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a useful [cheatsheet](https://www.anaconda.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/11-2018-JupyterLab-Notebook-Cheatsheet.pdf) on using Jupyter, and [another, on markdown syntax](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) for you to use.\n",
