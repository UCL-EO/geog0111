    "    \n",
    "The inputs could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    inputs:\n",

The first time a function is called within `reduce`, the function receives the first item from the iterator and an `initializer` value if given. If not given, it receives teh first two values.

    "PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) are design documents for Python. They are primarily aimed at developers of features in the language, but some also contain clear definitions of how to use the language well. The most important of these in the context of these materials of function development is PEP8, but PEP257 is also of relevance.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we have learned about writing a function. We have seen that they generally will have zero or more input positional arguments and zero or more keyword arguments. They will typically return some value. We have also seen how we can define a `doc string` to give the user information on how to use the function, and also how we can use `assert` to build tests for our codes. We have been through some design considerations, and seen that it is best to plan you functions by thinking about the purpose, the inputs and the outputs. Then, for the core code, you just need to develop a skeleton code and docstring structure, test that, and insert your core code. You should think about modifications using keyword arguments that you might want to include, but these will often come in a second pass of development.\n",
