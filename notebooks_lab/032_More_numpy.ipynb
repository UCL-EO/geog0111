    "The answer is that `np.argmin` operates on a 'flattened' version of the array. When we used it [above](032_More_numpy.ipynb#argmin,-argmax) this issue was not apparent because the input array was 1D.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to apply the flattened array index, we must first then flatten the array. There are two functions for this: `flatten` and `ravel`. They both have a similar effect, but `flatten` operates of a *copy* of the array. This means it uses more memory. But also any changes we make are not reflected in the original array. Very often we use `ravel` instead then. This takes no more memory, but any changes we make to the ravelled array will also happen to the original array. You should think carefully about which you use in any particular circumstance, but unless you really need to operate on a copy, you might generally use `ravel`."

We can recognise in the example above that it makes no difference to the processing whether we search for the `argmin` over a 1D or 2D array. It makes sense then to treat it as a 1D problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same sort of issues arise when we are dealing with image processing: although an image is defined over a 2D spatial extent, if the algorithm we are applying is operated independently per pixel, then this can be equally treated as a 1D problem. If we had a problem to solve over an image space and over a parameter space (as we come across see later) then we can simplify our data structure by collapsing unnecessary multi-dimensional arrays into 1D arrays. In that case, it might not always be possible to use `ravel` as we might need to 'flatten' different parts of the dataset in different fashions. For this, more refined control on array shape, we use `reshape`.\n",

The operation is a simple element-wise manipulation that `numpy` should be efficient at, even for large arrays.
