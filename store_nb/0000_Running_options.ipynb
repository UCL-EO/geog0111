    "\n",
    "There are many options for you to set up and run these notes. In this section, we will go through some of these. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should *not* wait until the first session to try this out: rather, read through these notes, and try out one or more of the options for yourself to make sure youy will be able to run the course. We can help with any problems or questions in the sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online services\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these services. The ones we have provided links to above (and in each notebook) are free for you to use. The general disadvantage may be that you need near continuous, reliable network access to these online servers. The main advantage is that you can run from anywhere (with reliable network ...) in any browser. There is no setup, and no use of any local resources.\n",

    "### Running on your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options you can use for running the course notes on your onwn computer. These all need network access *at some point*, so you can download the files you need. If you do this, you are responsible for your own backups, so might want to use some servive such as Google Drive, Dropbox etc. for backup. These would need only intermittent network access (i.e. not all of the time you are working). You could always sort your owen backup on local resources if network access is a real problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### docker\n",
    "\n",
    "In many ways, the simplest way to set up and run the notes on your own computer is to use [`docker`](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). First download and install the docker software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then download the docker file [`proflewis/geog0111:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/proflewis/geog0111) using the command line (e.g. in MacOS/Linux Terminal):\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker pull proflewis/geog0111:latest\n",
    "    \n",
    "or using the Docker desktop app (e.g. for Windows users).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then run jupyter lab with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 proflewis/geog0111:latest start.sh jupyter lab\n",
    "    \n",
    "This will point you to a url you can open in a browser, e.g. [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/?token=d710ebf6d9d26ccfe375d083d4e6ca86babea99410e0a9d5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can only have one jupyter session running on your computer at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to the notebook for the session (e.g. `notebooks/000_Running_options.ipynb`) and save any work you do. It will be there in the docker jupyter hub the next time you start it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You quit an `jupyter` notebook session within the docker browser under 'File'-->'Shur down' or with `^C` (`Control C`) in Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### anaconda and git\n",
    "\n",
    "The most flexible is to install [Anaconda python](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have done that, you can use `conda` at the command-line, or tools such as [`anaconda-navigator`](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to install [`git`](http://git-scm.com/) and `pip` as a minimum, to allow other mechanisms to download packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of files in `git`, you can also use various `git` desktop applications such as [`git desktop`](https://desktop.github.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we should now have `conda`, `pip` and `git` installed on the local computer. Yopu can test this by typing the following in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    which git conda pip\n",
    "    \n",
    "and this should respond with something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    /Users/jovian/anaconda3/envs/newform0111/bin/git\n",
    "    /Users/jovian/anaconda3/envs/newform0111/bin/conda\n",
    "    /Users/jovian/anaconda3/envs/newform0111/bin/pip\n",
    "\n",
    "If it doesn't respond with an appropriate path to these commands, try restarting your computer or session to see if that has updated things. If not, try installing them again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know we have these (i.e. conda, pip and git) packages, you can pull the course repository from github, typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone https://github.com/profLewis/newform0111.git\n",
    "    \n",
    "or using github desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To *install* the course notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd newform0111\n",
    "    conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you are *updating* the notes, and newform0111 already exists, use instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd newform0111\n",
    "    conda env update -f environment.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create an environment called `newform0111` and make sure you have all of the required dependencies (Hence, it's likely to take some time here, so just be patient with the installation).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have created the environment, you can activate it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda activate newform0111\n",
    "\n",
    "and finally, set up code and notebook features, using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    cd newform0111\n",
    "    python setup.py install\n",
    "    export PATH=\"${HOME}/.local/bin/:${PATH}\" && bash postBuild\n",
    "\n",
    "For further advice on checking, setting or deleting `conda` environments, see the [conda help pages](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the Jupyter notebook server, simply type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "    \n",
    "and navigate to the notebook  for the session (e.g. `notebooks/Chapter0_help.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You quit an `jupyter` notebook session with `^C` (`Control C`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To exectute ('run') blocks of Python code in the notebook, use `^<return>` (`SHIFT` and `RETURN` keys together).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, just run `ipython`:  \n",
    "```\n",
    "cd /directory/to/newform0111\n",
    "ipython\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and type your own commands in at the prompt, following the class or the material on the webpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a fast local computer, but only intermittant network access, you might like to go for a hybrid approach. For example, once you set up on google colab, you can save your notes and codes to your google drive, which you can have mirrored to your local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you could set up some online repository such as in github, and you can upload your work there once you have finished a session. If you do this, make sure it is not public though, as the course includes work you must submit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we first learned about some of the various options available for running these notebooks. You should try one or more out to see what suits you and your environment."
